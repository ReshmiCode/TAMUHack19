#TheraTracker

What it does:
TheraTracker keeps doctors and patients connected in between visits. The application has different functions based on the type of account of the person logged in. For example:

Doctors - Doctors have the ability to view their active patient list (specifically patients using the app that have agreed to share their data with their doctor) Based on the information that their patients choose to share, the doctor is able to generate reports. This can help show mood trends and sleep trends that can be discussed at their next appointment.

Patients - Patients are able to do the following tasks:
Track Mood (List and track their medications)
This includes the ability to send notifications to remind users to take their medication as well as know when they need to request refills.
